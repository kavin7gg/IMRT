🎯 IMRT Planning Agent with SARSA Optimization
🧠 Overview
IMRT Planning Agent with SARSA Optimization is an AI-driven healthcare project focused on enhancing Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) treatment planning for cancer patients.
This project leverages reinforcement learning—specifically the SARSA (State–Action–Reward–State–Action) algorithm—to automate and optimize the radiation dose delivery process.

The primary goal is to achieve an optimal balance between:

Delivering the prescribed radiation dose to tumor regions 🎯
Minimizing unnecessary exposure to surrounding healthy tissues 🫁💗
💡 Motivation
Traditional IMRT planning is an iterative, manual process performed by radiation physicists. It involves extensive fine-tuning of dose parameters to meet clinical objectives.
By introducing an AI-based approach, this project aims to:

Reduce manual trial-and-error in treatment planning
Improve consistency and precision of dose distribution
Enable faster, data-driven, and personalized therapy design
⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ Environment Simulation
The IMRT environment is modeled as a reinforcement learning problem:

States (S): Represent current dose distributions
Actions (A): Adjust radiation beam intensities or angles
Rewards (R): Quantify how well objectives are met (e.g., tumor coverage, tissue sparing)
2️⃣ Learning Algorithm – SARSA
SARSA (on-policy temporal-difference learning) allows the agent to:

Explore different dose configurations
Learn from trial and feedback
Converge toward the optimal dose plan through iterative updates
3️⃣ Optimization Objective
The agent seeks to maximize the total reward, where:

Positive reward → improved tumor targeting
Negative reward → overdose to critical organs
